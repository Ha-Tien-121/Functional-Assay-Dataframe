This normalization accounted for the differential survival of variants regardless of cisplatin treatment. The frequency of each variant was determined by counting barcodes in surviving cells collected 5 days after cisplatin treatment.

For example, aggregates of TDP-43 occur in nearly all cases of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). However, whether aggregates cause cellular toxicity is still not clear, even in simpler cellular systems. We reasoned that deep mutagenesis might be a powerful approach to disentangle the relationship between aggregation and toxicity. We generated >50,000 mutations in the prion-like domain (PRD) of TDP-43 and quantified their toxicity in yeast cells. Surprisingly, mutations that increase hydrophobicity and aggregation strongly decrease toxicity. In contrast, toxic variants promote the formation of dynamic liquid-like condensates. Mutations have their strongest effects in a hotspot that genetic interactions reveal to be structured in vivo, illustrating how mutagenesis can probe the in vivo structures of unstructured proteins. Our results show that aggregation of TDP-43 is not harmful but protects cells, most likely by titrating the protein away from a toxic liquid-like phase.",Bolognesi_Faure,2019,,primary score set,,,,,Journal,PMC,,,ENST00000240185.8,NM_007375.4,"The prion-like domain (PRD) of TDP-43 was comprehensively mutated using error-prone oligonucleotide synthesis to generate a library of over 50,000 variants, which was transformed into Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells. Expression of the TDP-43 variants was induced using a galactose-responsive promoter, with yeast cultures grown for approximately 50 hours in non-inducing medium before being transferred to galactose medium for the selection period. Deep sequencing was performed on samples taken before induction (input) and after 5-6 generations of growth under inducing conditions (output) across three biological replicates to track the frequency changes of each variant. The relative toxicity of variants was determined by how they affected yeast growth rate compared to wild-type TDP-43, with variants that decreased in frequency during selection deemed more toxic.

Specifically, for each variant, an enrichment score (ES) was calculated as the natural logarithm of the ratio between its frequency in the output and input samples. The relative toxicity of each variant was then determined by taking the difference between the wild-type TDP-43 enrichment score and the variant's enrichment score. This measurement was normalized by the number of cell doublings during selection to yield relative growth rates per generation.

To account for experimental uncertainty, error estimates combined expected Poisson error based on read counts with error between replicate selections. For double mutants that were underrepresented and often missing from output samples due to their toxicity, a Bayesian approach was implemented to estimate toxicity based on similar variants. The toxicity scores were further normalized between replicate selections and libraries, with distributions centered on the toxicity of synonymous variants and scaled so that stop codon variants had consistent toxicity values across libraries.

The functional classifications of TDP-43 variants were assigned based on statistical comparison to wild-type toxicity.

However, variants of uncertain significance limit the clinical utility of test results. Thus, there is a need for functional characterization and clinical classification of all BRCA2 variants to facilitate the clinical management of individuals with these variants. Here we analysed all possible single-nucleotide variants from exons 15 to 26 that encode the BRCA2 DNA-binding domain hotspot for pathogenic missense variants. To enable this, we used saturation genome editing CRISPR-Cas9-based knock-in endogenous targeting of human haploid HAP1 cells6. The assay was calibrated relative to nonsense and silent variants and was validated using pathogenic and benign standards from ClinVar and results from a homology-directed repair functional assay7. Variants (6,959 out of 6,960 evaluated) were assigned to seven categories of pathogenicity based on a VarCall Bayesian model8. Single-nucleotide variants that encode loss-of-function missense variants were associated with increased risks of breast cancer and ovarian cancer. The functional assay results were integrated into models from ClinGen, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics, and the Association for Molecular Pathology9 for clinical classification of BRCA2 variants. Using this approach, 91% were classified as pathogenic or likely pathogenic or as benign or likely benign.

A gene exemplifying the challenge of variant interpretation is the von Hippel-Lindautumor suppressor (VHL). VHL encodes an E3 ubiquitin ligase that regulates the cellular response to hypoxia. Germline pathogenic variants in VHL predispose patients to tumors including clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) and pheochromocytoma, and somatic VHL mutations are frequently observed in sporadic renal cancer. Here we optimize and apply saturation genome editing to assay nearly all possible single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) across VHL's coding sequence. To delineate mechanisms, we quantify mRNA dosage effects and compare functional effects in isogenic cell lines. Function scores for 2,268 VHL SNVs identify a core set of pathogenic alleles driving ccRCC with perfect accuracy, inform differential risk across tumor types and reveal new mechanisms by which variants impact function.

Scores were then normalized across exons using the range of effect sizes observed for synonymous and nonsense variants, with regional scores scaled linearly so the median nonsense variant equaled the global median nonsense value while the median synonymous variant was scaled to 0. Quality filtering was applied to exclude variants with low library or day 6 frequencies, discordant replicate measurements, or high estimated sequencing error.

For exonic variants, RNA scores were calculated by normalizing each coding SNV's frequency in RNA to its frequency in the corresponding genomic DNA sample from the same timepoint. These scores were determined for both day 6 and day 20 samples, reflecting the variant's effect on full-length VHL mRNA levels. RNA scores were only assigned to SNVs that had passed quality filtering for function scores, and noncoding variants were not assigned RNA scores as they would not be detectable in spliced transcripts. For variants covered by overlapping SGE regions, final RNA scores were determined by averaging the scores from both regions.

For RNA score classification, variants were assessed based on their impact on mRNA dosage. Variants with RNA scores below -3.0 were identified as having severe effects on mRNA levels, with 16 of 17 such variants also showing significantly depleted function scores, indicating a minimum mRNA dosage threshold required for normal VHL function. Comparison with SpliceAI predictions revealed that most variants with RNA scores below -3.0 had SpliceAI scores greater than 0.08 (median of 0.61), confirming splice disruption as the underlying mechanism. Notably, nonsense variants as a class showed minimal depletion in mRNA (median RNA score = -0.19), indicating limited nonsense-mediated decay. These RNA score classifications helped elucidate mechanisms of functional impairment beyond protein-level effects.RetryClaude can make mistakes.

The researchers observed that wild-type alleles depleted between time points, indicating incomplete prime editing at the first time point. To account for this continued editing, the log-fold-change value of the silent PAM-destroying mutation was subtracted from each score instead of the wild-type allele. The resulting values were normalized by dividing by the average score of nonsense mutations, multiplied by -1, and increased by 1, yielding a standardized scale where deleterious variants clustered around 0 and functional variants around 1. This normalization followed the same mathematical principle as for _NPC1_: final_score = 1 - (raw_score/mean_nonsense_score). For both gene assays, variant classification was performed using unsupervised mean-shift clustering with a cluster centered at a score of 1. A resampling approach across 1,000 permutations of the eight experimental replicates was implemented to ensure statistical robustness, with classifications retained only if they were consistent across at least 998 of 1,000 resamplings; otherwise, variants were classified as uncertain.","For BRCA2, the log-fold-change of each allele from the second to the first time point was calculated.

We observed that the benign cluster tends to be large and tightly bounded, and while there is a noticeable nonsense cluster, deleterious variants tend to display a wide variance. Our classification is based on defining what scores constitute the functional cluster, then classifying everything with a score below the lower bound of this cluster as deleterious. To define the functional cluster, unsupervised mean-shift clustering was employed. Specifically, a single cluster with a score of 1 was seeded—the centering adjustments to scores ensure the cluster center should be approximately equal to 1—and the mean-shift algorithm was implemented using Python scikit-learn package. All function scores that fall within this cluster will have their corresponding variant classified as functional. Arriving at the function score and this classification, however, required several processing steps—centering the data such that the wild-type or PAM-destroying mutation was approximately equal to 1 and the average nonsense score was approximately equal to 0, normalizing the data across different experiments and the mean-shift clustering—each of which might introduce some degree of error. To account for this, a resampling-based approach was adopted by taking a permutation of the eight experimental replicates and repeating the entire data analysis pipeline—centering, normalizing and classifying—1,000 times. Classifications were retained only if they were consistent across at least 998 of 1,000 resamplings, with anything not meeting this cut-off being classified as uncertain. Eight experimental replicates were chosen to ensure sufficient permutations were available to permit the described nonparametric analysis. Resampling as a means of testing the robustness of unsupervised clustering has been previously validated, though this study had multiple features to consider and employed a method called jackstrawing. We only have one feature—the function score—and eight replicates over which to consider it. With this dimensionally small dataset, we opted to resample all eight replicates for our analysis in the vein of a full nonparametric bootstrap.","Deleterious, Functional, Uncertain",Not reported,no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Computational Variant Effect Predictors (VEPs),"CADD, Spearman’s ρ=−0.44, N=426",Reported,38,8,Germline Variant Databases,ClinVar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,Yes,,,MONDO:0003582,612555

This was computed as log2(frequency_high/frequency_low) for each variant detected in the sequencing data. The wild-type sequencing read log-fold-change value was subtracted from each score to center the distribution and account for technical variation. These values were then normalized by dividing by the average score of nonsense mutations included as internal controls in each library, multiplied by -1, and increased by 1, resulting in a scale where functional variants approximated 1 and deleterious variants approximated 0, according to the formula: final_score = 1 - (raw_score/mean_nonsense_score).

While detectable in the amplicon sequencing, edits at scaffold-proximal positions tended to be represented at such low frequencies that their low read counts made for spurious log-fold-changes between replicates. Accordingly, when compiling the scores for classification, we removed edits made within these bases, ultimately discarding between 1 and 4 nucleotides or 3–12 variants from the downstream analysis.

A data-driven approach was taken for classifying functional variants, rather than choosing cut-off scores. We observed that the benign cluster tends to be large and tightly bounded, and while there is a noticeable nonsense cluster, deleterious variants tend to display a wide variance. Our classification is based on defining what scores constitute the functional cluster, then classifying everything with a score below the lower bound of this cluster as deleterious. To define the functional cluster, unsupervised mean-shift clustering was employed. Specifically, a single cluster with a score of 1 was seeded—the centering adjustments to scores ensure the cluster center should be approximately equal to 1—and the mean-shift algorithm was implemented using Python’s scikit-learn package. All function scores that fall within this cluster will have their corresponding variant classified as functional. Arriving at the function score and this classification, however, required several processing steps—centering the data such that the wild-type or PAM-destroying mutation was approximately equal to 1 and the average nonsense score was approximately equal to 0, normalizing the data across different experiments and the mean-shift clustering—each of which might introduce some degree of error.

This was computed as log2(frequency_high/frequency_low) for each variant detected in the sequencing data. The wild-type sequencing read log-fold-change value was subtracted from each score to center the distribution and account for technical variation. These values were then normalized by dividing by the average score of nonsense mutations included as internal controls in each library, multiplied by -1, and increased by 1, resulting in a scale where functional variants approximated 1 and deleterious variants approximated 0, according to the formula: final_score = 1 - (raw_score/mean_nonsense_score).

While detectable in the amplicon sequencing, edits at scaffold-proximal positions tended to be represented at such low frequencies that their low read counts made for spurious log-fold-changes between replicates. Accordingly, when compiling the scores for classification, we removed edits made within these bases, ultimately discarding between 1 and 4 nucleotides or 3–12 variants from the downstream analysis.

However, a rigorous assessment of the clinical value of multiplexed functional data for variant interpretation is lacking. Thus, we systematically combined previously published _BRCA1_, _TP53_, and _PTEN_ multiplexed functional data with phenotype and family history data for 324 VUSs identified by a single diagnostic testing laboratory. We curated 49,281 variant functional scores from MAVEs for these three genes and integrated four different _TP53_ multiplexed functional datasets into a single functional prediction for each variant by using machine learning. We then determined the strength of evidence provided by each multiplexed functional dataset and reevaluated 324 VUSs.

The challenge they pose is epitomized by _BRCA1_, a tumour suppressor gene in which germline loss-of-function variants predispose women to breast and ovarian cancer. Although BRCA1 has been sequenced in millions of women, the risk associated with most newly observed variants cannot be definitively assigned. Here we use saturation genome editing to assay 96.5% of all possible single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) in 13 exons that encode functionally critical domains of _BRCA1_. Functional effects for nearly 4,000 SNVs are bimodally distributed and almost perfectly concordant with established assessments of pathogenicity. Over 400 non-functional missense SNVs are identified, as well as around 300 SNVs that disrupt expression.

Initially, the log2 ratio of each SNV's frequency at day 11 relative to the original plasmid library was calculated. Positional biases in editing rates were subsequently modeled using a LOESS regression fit on day 5 over library SNV ratios and were subtracted from the raw scores to correct for integration efficiency variations across the targeted regions. This adjustment was necessitated by the short gene conversion tracts arising during homology-directed repair (HDR) in human cells, which resulted in library SNVs being introduced more frequently near the CRISPR target site. To facilitate cross-exon comparisons, scores were normalized such that each experiment's median synonymous and nonsense SNV values were aligned with their respective global medians. This normalization enabled direct comparison of functional effects across all 13 exons encoding the RING and BRCT domains of BRCA1.

For threshold determination and variant classification, a two-component Gaussian mixture model was applied to the normalized functional scores. The model was fit using the distributions of nonsense SNVs (defined as the non-functional distribution) and synonymous SNVs with RNA scores within one standard deviation of the median (defined as the functional distribution). The posterior probabilities generated from the model were utilized as point estimates of the probability of each SNV's score being drawn from the non-functional distribution (Pnf). Variants were classified as ""non-functional"" (Pnf > 0.99), ""intermediate"" (0.01 < Pnf < 0.99), or ""functional"" (Pnf < 0.01).

CHK2 phosphorylation of the tumor suppressor BRCA1 is also important for mitotic spindle assembly and chromosomal stability. Consistent with its cell-cycle checkpoint role, both germline and somatic variants in CHEK2 have been linked to breast and other cancers. Over 90% of clinical germline CHEK2 missense variants are classified as variants of uncertain significance, complicating diagnosis of CHK2-dependent cancer. We therefore sought to test the functional impact of all possible missense variants in CHK2. Using a scalable multiplexed assay based on the ability of human CHK2 to complement DNA sensitivity of Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells lacking the CHEK2 ortholog, RAD53, we generated a systematic ""missense variant effect map"" for CHEK2 missense variation. The map reflects known biochemical features of CHK2 while offering new biological insights. It also provides strong evidence toward pathogenicity for some clinical missense variants and supporting evidence toward benignity for others.

Errors were corrected by subtraction of the frequency of variants in wild-type control samples. The log ratios were rescaled so that synonymous variants (assumed to be functional) had a median score of 1, and nonsense variants (assumed to be non-functional) had a median score of 0. Measurement error was regularized using a statistical method described by Baldi and Long, with uncertainty propagated via bootstrapping. For quality filtering, variants with fewer than 10 reads in the pre-selection library were filtered out. Variants whose pre-selection frequencies were statistically indistinguishable from wild-type control were removed. Variants with high divergence between replicates were filtered out. For clinical analysis, variants with scores in the ambiguous range (around 0.5) were further filtered.

The CHK2 variant effect map scores were converted into clinical assertions (evidence strength) through a systematic approach using log-likelihood ratios (LLRs). Probability density functions were initially estimated separately for scores from the positive reference variants (pathogenic) and negative reference variants (benign) using kernel density estimation with a Gaussian kernel. The log-likelihood ratio (LLR) was then calculated for each variant as the log ratio of these two probability densities, regularized against a uniform distribution. These LLR values were subsequently calibrated to the ACMG/AMP variant classification framework using the approach described by Tavtigian et al. (2018) as adapted by van Loggerenberg et al. Specific LLR thresholds were established corresponding to different evidence strengths: LLR values above 2.5 were assigned ""PS3_very strong"" evidence of pathogenicity; LLR values between 1.3 and 2.5 were designated as ""PS3_strong"" evidence of pathogenicity; LLR values from 0.64 to 1.3 were classified as ""PS3_moderate"" evidence of pathogenicity; LLR values from 0.32 to 0.64 were deemed ""PS3_supporting"" evidence of pathogenicity; and LLR values between -0.32 and -1.32 were considered ""BS3_supporting"" evidence of benignity.","An enrichment log ratio was calculated for each variant by comparing its frequency in post-selection versus pre-selection pools. Errors were corrected by subtraction of the frequency of variants in wild-type control samples. The log ratios were rescaled so that synonymous variants (assumed to be functional) had a median score of 1, and nonsense variants (assumed to be non-functional) had a median score of 0.; An analysis pipeline called TileseqMave (v.1.0.0) was used for the generation of the variant effect map (code, installation instructions, and documentation are available on Github at https://github.com/rothlab/tileseqMave). TileseqMave uses bowtie2 forward and reverse reads to the CHEK2 reference sequence. For each divergent base call, the posterior probability of being a true variant is calculated. Variants with posteriors exceeding a threshold of 0.9 are counted. For each codon change, a “marginal count” is calculated, i.e., the number of times the change was observed irrespective of other co-occurring variants. To calculate the frequency of each codon change, the marginal count for each mutation is normalized by its “effective sequencing depth,” i.e., the number of reads in which the variant call at the given position was decidable. An error-corrected enrichment log ratio is then calculated by subtracting the frequency of the variant in the corresponding WT control from the post- and pre-selection frequencies and calculating the log ratio between the latter. (Where multiple sequencing runs were required to obtain sufficient read counts, we subtracted counts from matched WT control libraries before aggregating counts.) Finally, the enrichment log ratio is rescaled such that, after rescaling, synonymous variants have a median score of 1 and nonsense variants a median score of 0. For each variant, measurement error is regularized using the method described by Baldi and Long28 and propagated via bootstrapping.

To include only well-measured results, we filtered out variants that were seen in fewer than ten reads in the pre-selection library and those for which pre-selection frequencies were statistically indistinguishable from those in the WT control. We also removed variants for which replicates diverged by more than three times the amount expected based on their Poisson variance, given their underlying read count.

To identify the highest-quality scores for clinical analysis, we removed variants for which the interval of a variant’s score plus and minus error included 0.5 (the midpoint between synonymous and nonsense).",Frequency Ratio,Dual Reference (Synonymous vs Nonsense or WT vs Abnormal),No,No,Raw score,CHEK2 variants were transformed into yeast cells lacking RAD53 and SML1 and grown in 0.007% MMS,2,Yeast transformants grown in non-selective conditions were split into two replicates plated on selective media.,Yes,PCC of 0.64 and p < 1e−320 (Replicate log(ɸ) scores),in-vitro construct library,coding,Entire ORF,"All possible single codon changes (missense variants, synonymous, nonsense) throughout the CHEK2 coding sequence, created using NNK-degenerate codons",Codon (Degenerate - NNK),"missense_variant (SO:0001583), synonymous_variant (SO:0001819), stop_gained (SO:0001587)","amino_acid_substitution (SO:0001606), polypeptide_truncation (SO:0001617)",synthetic target sequence,,oligo-directed mutagenic PCR,precision oligo-pool-based code alteration (POPCode),plasmid (not integrated),chemical or heat shock transformation,,single-segment (short read),direct sequencing,,,single-dimensional data,Reported,424,419,"Wild Type, Empty Vector/Null, Synonymous, Nonsense",also WT and empty vector,"The scores were calibrated so that the median of synonymous variants was set to 1 and the median of nonsense variants to 0.

Hypoactive variants are concentrated at buried positions, near the active site, and at a region of known importance for GCK conformational dynamics.

Activity scores for glucokinase (GCK) variants were calculated based on the change in variant frequency before and after selection. The relative frequency of each variant was determined from deep sequencing data obtained pre-selection and post-selection. These frequency changes were then converted to activity scores through a normalization process where synonymous variants were scaled to have scores centered on one, and nonsense variants were scaled to have scores centered on zero. Bayesian regularization was applied to refine the standard deviations associated with each score, improving the statistical robustness of the measurements.

Activity scores were used to classify GCK variants into functional categories based on receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analyses. These analyses were performed using previously classified pathogenic and benign variants as a training set. The threshold for variants associated with GCK-MODY (maturity-onset diabetes of the young) was determined to be 0.66 (AUC = 0.88), meaning variants with activity scores below this value were classified as loss-of-function. Variants with activity scores above 1.18 were predicted to be associated with hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia (HH) (AUC = 0.94), classifying them as gain-of-function variants. Variants with scores between these thresholds were considered to have wild-type-like activity.

Understanding their mechanistic basis may pinpoint how residues contribute to protein function. Here, we characterize the mechanisms underlying variant effects in human glucokinase (GCK) variants, building on our previous comprehensive study on GCK variant activity. Results: Using a yeast growth-based assay, we score the abundance of 95% of GCK missense and nonsense variants. When combining the abundance scores with our previously determined activity scores, we find that 43% of hypoactive variants also decrease cellular protein abundance. The low-abundance variants are enriched in the large domain, while residues in the small domain are tolerant to mutations with respect to abundance. Instead, many variants in the small domain perturb GCK conformational dynamics which are essential for appropriate activity.

The sequencing was performed across 14 overlapping tiles covering the entire GCK ORF, with each tile being sequenced on both strands to minimize base-calling errors. The raw sequencing reads were processed by the TileSeqMave and TileSeq mutation count bioinformatic pipelines, and the relative enrichment or depletion of each variant following selection was calculated. Potential PCR errors were accounted for by subtracting variant frequencies observed in a wild-type GCK control from those in both the non-selective and selective conditions. Unreliable data points were removed through quality filtering based on the agreement between replicate measurements and variant counts in the non-selective condition. The resulting abundance scores were statistically normalized so that a median score of zero was assigned to nonsense variants (which typically eliminate protein function), while a median score of one was assigned to synonymous variants (which generally maintain normal protein levels). Standard errors for these abundance scores were refined using Bayesian regularization, whereby empirical standard errors were combined with prior estimates obtained through linear regression of fitness scores against read counts, and more robust error estimates were provided particularly for variants with low read counts.

A threshold of 0.58 was determined for the abundance scores by fitting the distribution with three Gaussian components, representing nonsense-like variants, intermediate variants, and synonymous-like variants. The intersection point between the second and third Gaussian distributions was selected as the cutoff value to objectively classify variants as having decreased or normal abundance. Variants were classified as having low abundance if their abundance score fell below the 0.58 threshold, while those with scores above this value were considered to have normal abundance.

Although variant detection rates are high for this disease, there is uncertainty associated with the classification of missense variants that leads to reduced diagnostic yield. Consequently, up to 85% of reported JAG1 missense variants have uncertain or conflicting classifications. We generated a library of 2,832 JAG1 nucleotide variants within exons 1-7, a region with a high number of reported missense variants, and designed a high-throughput assay to measure JAG1 membrane expression, a requirement for normal function. After calibration using a set of 175 known or predicted pathogenic and benign variants included within the variant library, 486 variants were characterized as functionally abnormal (n = 277 abnormal and n = 209 likely abnormal), of which 439 (90.3%) were missense. We identified divergent membrane expression occurring at specific residues, indicating that loss of the wild-type residue itself does not drive pathogenicity, a finding supported by structural modeling data and with broad implications for clinical variant classification both for Alagille syndrome and globally across other disease genes. Of 144 uncertain variants reported in patients undergoing clinical or research testing, 27 had functionally abnormal membrane expression, and inclusion of our data resulted in the reclassification of 26 to likely pathogenic.

Deep mutational scanning is a complementary approach that can simultaneously assess function of thousands of variants. Methods: We have developed and validated a method to perform a deep mutational scan of variants in SCN5A, which encodes the major voltage-gated sodium channel in the heart. We created a library of nearly all possible variants in a 36 base region of SCN5A in the S4 voltage sensor of domain IV and stably integrated the library into HEK293T cells. Results: In preliminary experiments, challenge with 3 drugs (veratridine, brevetoxin, and ouabain) could discriminate wild-type channels from gain- and loss-of-function pathogenic variants. High-throughput sequencing of the pre- and postdrug challenge pools was used to count the prevalence of each variant and identify variants with abnormal function. The deep mutational scan scores identified 40 putative gain-of-function and 33 putative loss-of-function variants. For 8 of 9 variants, patch clamping data were consistent with the scores.

Sequencing reads were stringently filtered for quality; we require each base have a Phred score greater than 20 and no uncalled bases. Second, a weighted linear least squares regression line is fit to the normalized frequency ratios across time points. Third, the slope of the regression line is calculated, averaged across the three replicates and log2 transformed. This averaged log2 slope reflects a variant’s aggregation propensity.

While more than 4,000 unique VUSs, comprised of missense or intronic variants, have been identified in _BRCA2_, the few missense variants now classified clinically as pathogenic or likely pathogenic are predominantly located in the region encoding the C-terminal DNA binding domain (DBD). We report on functional evaluation of the influence of 462 _BRCA2_ missense variants affecting the DBD on DNA repair activity of _BRCA2_ using a homology-directed DNA double-strand break repair assay. Of these, 137 were functionally abnormal, 313 were functionally normal, and 12 demonstrated intermediate function. Comparisons with other functional studies of _BRCA2_ missense variants yielded strong correlations. Sequence-based in silico prediction models had high sensitivity, but limited specificity, relative to the homology-directed repair assay. Combining the functional results with clinical and genetic data in an American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG)/Association for Molecular Pathology (AMP)-like variant classification framework from a clinical testing laboratory, after excluding known splicing variants and functionally intermediate variants, classified 431 of 442 (97.5%) missense variants (129 as pathogenic/likely pathogenic and 302 as benign/likely benign). Functionally abnormal variants classified as pathogenic by ACMG/AMP rules were associated with a slightly lower risk of breast cancer (odds ratio [OR] 5.15, 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.43-7.83) than _BRCA2_ DBD protein truncating variants (OR 8.56, 95% CI 6.03-12.36).

However, variants of uncertain significance limit the clinical utility of test results. Thus, there is a need for functional characterization and clinical classification of all _BRCA2_ variants to facilitate the clinical management of individuals with these variants. Here we analysed all possible single-nucleotide variants from exons 15 to 26 that encode the _BRCA2_ DNA-binding domain hotspot for pathogenic missense variants. To enable this, we used saturation genome editing CRISPR-Cas9-based knock-in endogenous targeting of human haploid HAP1 cells. The assay was calibrated relative to nonsense and silent variants and was validated using pathogenic and benign standards from ClinVar and results from a homology-directed repair functional assay. Variants (6,959 out of 6,960 evaluated) were assigned to seven categories of pathogenicity based on a VarCall Bayesian model. Single-nucleotide variants that encode loss-of-function missense variants were associated with increased risks of breast cancer and ovarian cancer. The functional assay results were integrated into models from ClinGen, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics, and the Association for Molecular Pathology for clinical classification of _BRCA2_ variants.

Frequencies were first determined by correcting raw read counts of each mutant codon by subtracting mutation-specific error read counts from wild-type MSH2 plasmid tile-seq, which were rescaled to match the same total read count. Any resulting negative counts were clipped to the value 0.9, and per-mutation corrected frequencies were then obtained by dividing corrected counts by total reads. Variants substantially depleted after mock treatment (log2 ratio ≤−2, after two passages blasticidin versus P0) were removed as these were suspected to contain frameshift or premature truncating mutations beyond the sequenced tile. For amino acid substitutions represented by multiple equivalent codon substitutions, the median was taken across those codons' LoF scores to yield an amino acid-level LoF score. The final step involved filtering variants within each replicate when represented by exactly two LoF scores with opposite signs, and calculating the median score across the three biological replicates, with variants being removed when only two replicate scores with discordant signs remained.

Functional classifications of MSH2 variants were assigned based on the calculated Loss-of-function (LoF) scores using a simple binary threshold approach. Variants with positive LoF scores (>0) were classified as functionally deleterious, indicating they were enriched in the 6-thioguanine (6-TG) treatment condition compared to mock treatment. Conversely, variants with negative LoF scores (≤0) were classified as functionally neutral, indicating they were depleted or maintained similar frequencies after 6-TG selection. ","A loss-of-function (LoF) score was taken as the log2 ratio of the frequency after 6-TG treatment over that after mock treatment (For LoF scores, a score cutoff of 0 was selected a priori, taking as deleterious any variants enriched by 6-TG.); variants with frequencies ≤1/200,000 in both mock and 6-TG selections were discarded. For amino acid substitutions represented by more than one equivalent codon substitution, the median was taken across those codons’ LoF scores to yield an amino acid-level LoF score. Within each replicate, variants were removed when represented by exactly two LoF scores with opposite signs.

All 17 pathogenic variant controls had reduced current density, and 13 of 14 benign variant controls had normal current density, which enabled determination of normal and abnormal ranges for applying evidence of moderate or supporting strength for VUS reclassification.

Variants in _KCNH2_ that lead to decreased IKr have been associated with long QT syndrome type 2 (LQT2). The mechanism of LQT2 is most often induced loss of KV11.1 trafficking to the cell surface. Accurately discriminating between variants with normal and abnormal trafficking would aid in understanding the deleterious nature of these variants; however, the volume of reported nonsynonymous _KCNH2_ variants precludes the use of conventional methods for functional study. Objective: The purpose of this study was to report a high-throughput, multiplexed screening method for _KCNH2_ genetic variants capable of measuring the cell surface abundance of hundreds of missense variants in the resulting KV11.1 channel. Methods: We developed a method to quantitate KV11.1 variant trafficking on a pilot region of 11 residues in the S5 helix. Results: We generated trafficking scores for 220 of 231 missense variants in the pilot region. For 5 of 5 variants, high-throughput trafficking scores validated when tested in single variant flow cytometry and confocal microscopy experiments. We further explored these results with planar patch electrophysiology and found that loss-of-trafficking variants do not produce IKr. Conversely, but expectedly, some variants that traffic normally were still functionally compromised. Conclusion: We describe a new method for detecting KV11.1 trafficking-deficient variants in a multiplexed assay. This new method accurately generated trafficking data for variants in KV11.1 and is extendable both to all residues in KV11.1 and to other cell surface proteins.",Kozek_Glazer,2020,,primary score set,,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7704534/bin/NIHMS1601535-supplement-2.xls,"DMS_scores_v2, column G score.ave, cols E and F for individual scores",Journal,PMC,,ENST00000262186,ENST00000262186.10,NM_000238.4,"A flow cytometry-based assay was used to measure KV11.1 (_KCNH2_) surface expression.

First, the relative abundance of each variant barcode was determined in each sorted cell pool by dividing its read count by the total number of reads in that pool. These relative abundances were then transformed using a weighted average formula: Score = Σ(wi × pi), where pi represents the proportion of a variant in pool i, and wi represents the weight assigned to that pool based on its surface expression level. The weights were calibrated using known control variants to maximize separation between wildtype and non-trafficking variants, with highest weight assigned to the pool with greatest surface expression.

Functional classification thresholds were established through empirical analysis of the score distribution across all 220 variants tested. The score of 75 was selected as the threshold for wildtype-like function based on the mean score of synonymous variants (101) minus approximately 25% to account for natural variation. The severe loss-of-trafficking threshold of 25 was determined based on the distribution of nonsense variants, which had a mean score of 5, with a generous margin added to minimize false positives. The intermediate thresholds (50) was positioned to create equal-width classification bins between wildtype-like and severe loss-of-trafficking categories. These thresholds were validated by examining the distribution of previously characterized variants and confirmed by single-variant validation experiments, which showed that variants with scores below 25 consistently failed to produce measurable currents in electrophysiological assays.","weighted average of the abundance of each barcode in the four pools; For each barcode, a raw trafficking score was calculated as the weighted average of the abundance of each barcode (i) in the four pools:

The scores were then aggregated by variant and normalized with a linear transformation so that trafficking score ranged from 0 (barcodes only observed in the AF647 negative pool) to 100 for WT.

More than 50% of patients clinically diagnosed with a myopathy carry a variant of unknown significance in a myopathy gene, often leaving them without a genetic diagnosis. Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) type R4/2E is caused by mutations in β-sarcoglycan (SGCB). Together, β-, α-, γ-, and δ-sarcoglycan form a 4-protein transmembrane complex (SGC) that localizes to the sarcolemma. Biallelic loss-of-function mutations in any subunit can lead to LGMD. To provide functional evidence for the pathogenicity of missense variants, we performed deep mutational scanning of SGCB and assessed SGC cell surface localization for all 6,340 possible amino acid changes. Variant functional scores were bimodally distributed and perfectly predicted pathogenicity of known variants. Variants with less severe functional scores more often appeared in patients with slower disease progression, implying a relationship between variant function and disease severity. Amino acid positions intolerant to variation mapped to points of predicted SGC interactions, validated in silico structural models, and enabled accurate prediction of pathogenic variants in other SGC genes.

For each sample, raw read counts for mutant codons were processed to calculate per-mutation frequencies. When multiple codon changes resulted in the same amino acid substitution, the median value was taken to produce a single amino acid-level score. The functional scores were then mathematically calculated as the log10 ratio of variant frequency in bin 4 (high expression) divided by its frequency in bin 1 (low expression). These raw scores underwent normalization across all library sections to establish a consistent scale where synonymous mutations were centered at a mean of 0 with a standard deviation of 0.5. Data processing included normalization to account for technical variation between library sections, with biological replicates being integrated by taking the median score across experiments. This approach resulted in a bimodal distribution of scores that ranged from -2.9 to 1.46, with functionally deleterious variants scoring negatively and neutral variants scoring positively

Functional classifications were assigned based on the normalized functional score distribution, with a clear bimodal pattern enabling distinction between deleterious and neutral variants. Variants with functional scores below -0.5 were classified as deleterious (nonfunctional), while those with scores above -0.5 were considered neutral (functional). This cutoff was established by analyzing the distribution of scores from known reference variants - synonymous variants had scores averaging 0 (range -0.05 to 1.2), while nonsense mutations averaged -1.5 (±0.8). ","Functional scores were taken as the log10 ratio of the variant's frequency in bin 4 (high expression) divided by its frequency in bin 1 (low expression). The scores were then normalized across chunks (sublibraries) such that the functional scores for synonymous mutations in each chunk had an average of 0 and a standard deviation of 0.5.

After normalization, stringent quality control filters were implemented, wherein isolates containing secondary mutations were identified and excluded from further analysis. A weighted least-squares regression model was then fitted to the filtered dataset, through which variant-specific growth estimates were calculated relative to control strains. The final functional scores were established by rescaling these estimates on a standardized scale, in which growth of null controls was fixed at 0 and wild-type yOTC growth was designated as 1. Statistical significance between variant distributions was determined by permutation testing, whereby p-values were calculated through comparison of observed medians to null distributions generated from one million random samples drawn without replacement from appropriate variant subsets.

First, the enrichment of each variant (Evar) was calculated as the ratio of variant reads to total reads at that position within each FACS-sorted population (high-glycosylation and low-glycosylation). Then, the relative enrichment (rE) was determined by dividing the enrichment in the high-glycosylation group by the enrichment in the low-glycosylation group. This was performed separately for both variants and wild-type sequences. The final functional score for each variant was calculated as the ratio of the variant's relative enrichment to that of the wild-type sequence in the corresponding block.

Experimentally characterizing millions of possible missense variants in thousands of clinically important genes requires generalizable, scalable assays. We describe variant abundance by massively parallel sequencing (VAMP-seq), which measures the effects of thousands of missense variants of a protein on intracellular abundance simultaneously. We apply VAMP-seq to quantify the abundance of 7,801 single-amino-acid variants of PTEN and TPMT, proteins in which functional variants are clinically actionable. We identify 1,138 PTEN and 777 TPMT variants that result in low protein abundance, and may be pathogenic or alter drug metabolism, respectively. We observe selection for low-abundance PTEN variants in cancer, and show that p.Pro38Ser, which accounts for ~10% of PTEN missense variants in melanoma, functions via a dominant-negative mechanism. Finally, we demonstrate that VAMP-seq is applicable to other genes, highlighting its generalizability.",Matreyek,2018,,primary score set,,,https://abundance.gs.washington.edu/shiny/stability/,,Project Website,MaveDB,dead link,,ENST00000371953.8,NM_000314.8,"PTEN function was assessed using Variant Abundance by Massively Parallel Sequencing (VAMP-seq), which measures the steady-state abundance of protein variants in cultured human cells. In this method, each PTEN variant was N-terminally tagged with EGFP and recombined into a single genomic locus of an engineered HEK 293T cell line, with mCherry co-expressed to control for expression levels. The stability of each variant dictated the abundance of the EGFP fusion, creating a range of cellular fluorescence signals that were detected by flow cytometry, with cells sorted into bins based on their EGFP:mCherry ratio.

Total frequency values (Fv,total) for each variant were calculated by dividing the total count of each variant by the total count of all variants across bins, and these values were subsequently used to filter out low-frequency variants that would be susceptible to counting noise. The Fv,total filtering threshold was carefully established by analyzing how different minimum values affected the distribution of synonymous variants, which were expected to form a clear, unimodal distribution around wild-type (WT). For variants passing this threshold, weighted averages (Wv) were calculated for each experiment and then subjected to min-max normalization using the wild-type value (Wwt=1) and the median value for non-terminal nonsense variants as reference points, thereby generating variant-specific abundance scores (Sv). The final abundance scores were computed by taking the mean of normalized scores across replicate experiments, with variants being retained only if they were scored in two or more replicates, and standard errors were calculated by dividing the standard deviation of normalized values by the square root of the number of replicates in which each variant was observed.

Synonymous score threshold was calculated by finding score that separated the 95% most abundant synonymous variants from the 5% lowest abundance variants was used to establish a synonymous score threshold; Abnormal (low abundance) variants had scores with confidence intervals below this threshold and normal (wild-type-like) variants had scores with confidence intervals above this threshold. Scores whose confidence intervals crossed this threshold were considered to be possibly abnormal if below and possibly normal if above.","The count for each variant in a bin was divided by the sum of counts recorded in that bin to obtain the frequency of each variant (Fv) within that bin. This calculation was repeated for every bin in each replicate experiment. For each experiment, the total count of each variant across the bins was divided by the total count of all variants across the bins to obtain a total frequency value (Fv,total) for each variant for each experiment. This total frequency value was used for filtering low-frequency variants, which we reasoned would be subject to high levels of counting noise, out of the subsequent calculations. We set the Fv,total filtering threshold based on the assumption that accurately scored synonymous variants should create a clear, unimodal distribution around WT. We examined how different minimum Fv,total filtering threshold values affected the spread and central tendency of the synonymous distribution. Next, for each experiment, a weighted average was calculated for each variant (Wv) passing the Fv,total filtering threshold value. Finally, for each experiment, an abundance score for each variant (Sv) was obtained by subjecting the weighted average of each variant to min-max normalization, using the weighted average value of WT (Wwt), which was given a score of 1, and the median weighted average value for non-terminal nonsense variants. The final abundance score for each variant was calculated by taking the mean of the min-max normalized abundance scores across the eight replicate experiments in which it could have been observed. Only variants which were scored in two or more replicate experiments were retained in the analysis. We implemented this filter because many sources of noise are not captured in count-based estimates of variance and because having replicate-level variance estimates was critical to our abundance classification scheme. A standard error for each abundance score was calculated by dividing the standard deviation of the min-max normalized values for each variant by the square root of the number of replicate experiments in which it was observed. Lastly, the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval was calculated by multiplying the standard error by the 97.5 percentile value of a normal distribution and subtracting this product from the abundance score. The upper bound of the 95% confidence interval was calculated by instead adding the product to the abundance score.

To understand how changes of PAX6:DNA binding cause these phenotypes, we combined saturation mutagenesis of the paired domain of PAX6 with a yeast one-hybrid (Y1H) assay in which expression of a PAX6-GAL4 fusion gene drives antibiotic resistance. We quantified binding of more than 2700 single amino-acid variants to two DNA sequence elements. Mutations in DNA-facing residues of the N-terminal subdomain and linker region were most detrimental, as were mutations to prolines and to negatively charged residues. Many variants caused sequence-specific molecular gain-of-function effects, including variants in position 71 that increased binding to the LE9 enhancer but decreased binding to a SELEX-derived binding site. In the absence of antibiotic selection, variants that retained DNA binding slowed yeast growth, likely because such variants perturbed the yeast transcriptome.

To understand how changes of PAX6:DNA binding cause these phenotypes, we combined saturation mutagenesis of the paired domain of PAX6 with a yeast one-hybrid (Y1H) assay in which expression of a PAX6-GAL4 fusion gene drives antibiotic resistance. We quantified binding of more than 2700 single amino-acid variants to two DNA sequence elements. Mutations in DNA-facing residues of the N-terminal subdomain and linker region were most detrimental, as were mutations to prolines and to negatively charged residues. Many variants caused sequence-specific molecular gain-of-function effects, including variants in position 71 that increased binding to the LE9 enhancer but decreased binding to a SELEX-derived binding site. In the absence of antibiotic selection, variants that retained DNA binding slowed yeast growth, likely because such variants perturbed the yeast transcriptome. Benchmarking against known patient variants and applying ACMG/AMP guidelines to variant classification, we obtained supporting-to-moderate evidence that 977 variants are likely pathogenic and 1306 are likely benign. Our analysis shows that most pathogenic mutations in the paired domain of PAX6 can be explained simply by the effects of these mutations on PAX6:DNA association, and establishes Y1H as a generalisable assay for the interpretation of variant effects in transcription factors.",McDonnell,2024,_LE9_no_geneticin,primary score set,,,,,"Journal, MaveDB, Other",,Also archived at https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biostudies/sourcedata/studies/S-SCDT-10_1038-S44320-024-00043-8,,ENST00000640610.1,NM_000280.6,"A Yeast one-hybrid (Y1H) assay was used to measure PAX6 function.

In this system, PAX6 variants that maintained DNA binding ability allowed yeast cells to grow in geneticin-containing media, while variants with impaired binding were depleted. The assay involved a saturation mutagenesis library of PAX6 paired domain variants, with samples collected at 12-hour intervals over 36 hours during competitive growth, both with and without geneticin selection.

Samples were collected at 12-hour intervals (T=0, 12, 24, and 36), and barcode frequencies were quantified via next-generation sequencing with a minimum threshold of 25 reads per barcode at T=0. The Enrich2 software package was then employed to calculate fitness scores by modeling the change in barcode frequencies over time, effectively measuring the rate of enrichment or depletion for each variant relative to the population. These raw scores were normalized so that wild-type variants had a mean score of 0, with positive scores indicating increased function and negative scores indicating decreased function.

Variant classification was performed by applying statistical criteria to the normalized fitness scores. For each variant, p-values were calculated under two null hypotheses: that the variant behaves like wild-type (pWT) and that it behaves like a nonsense variant (pnonsense). All p-values were adjusted using the Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR) method. Based on these adjusted q-values and fitness scores, variants were categorized into five functional groups: ""increased"" (fitness score > 0 and qWT < 0.05), ""neutral"" (qWT > 0.05), ""hypomorphic"" (fitness score between 0 and mean nonsense score, with both qWT < 0.05 and qnonsense < 0.05), ""LOF"" (loss-of-function, qnonsense > 0.05), and ""toxic"" (fitness score < mean nonsense score and qnonsense < 0.05).

Germline PTEN mutations are also associated with a range of clinical outcomes, including PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome (PHTS) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). To empower new insights into PTEN function and clinically relevant genotype-phenotype relationships, we systematically evaluated the effect of PTEN mutations on lipid phosphatase activity in vivo. Using a massively parallel approach that leverages an artificial humanized yeast model, we derived high-confidence estimates of functional impact for 7,244 single amino acid PTEN variants (86% of possible). We identified 2,273 mutations with reduced cellular lipid phosphatase activity, which includes 1,789 missense mutations. These data recapitulated known functional findings but also uncovered new insights into PTEN protein structure, biochemistry, and mutation tolerance. Several residues in the catalytic pocket showed surprising mutational tolerance. We identified that the solvent exposure of wild-type residues is a critical determinant of mutational tolerance. Further, we created a comprehensive functional map by leveraging correlations between amino acid substitutions to impute functional scores for all variants, including those not present in the assay.

KCNE1 variants are associated with long QT syndrome and atrial fibrillation. However, most variants have insufficient evidence of clinical consequences and thus limited clinical utility. Methods: In this study, we leveraged the power of variant effect mapping, which couples saturation mutagenesis with high-throughput sequencing, to ascertain the function of thousands of protein-coding KCNE1 variants. Results: We comprehensively assayed KCNE1 variant cell surface expression (2554/2709 possible single-amino-acid variants) and function (2534 variants). Our study identified 470 loss- or partial loss-of-surface expression and 574 loss- or partial loss-of-function variants. Of the 574 loss- or partial loss-of-function variants, 152 (26.5%) had reduced cell surface expression, indicating that most functionally deleterious variants affect channel gating. Nonsense variants at residues 56-104 generally had WT-like trafficking scores but decreased functional scores, indicating that the latter half of the protein is dispensable for protein trafficking but essential for channel function. 22 of the 30 KCNE1 residues (73%) highly intolerant of variation (with > 70% loss-of-function variants) were in predicted close contact with binding partners KCNQ1 or calmodulin. Our functional assay data were consistent with gold standard electrophysiological data (ρ = - 0.64), population and patient cohorts (32/38 presumed benign or pathogenic variants with consistent scores), and computational predictors (ρ = - 0.62). Our data provide moderate-strength evidence for the American College of Medical Genetics/Association of Molecular Pathology functional criteria for benign and pathogenic variants.

A weighted average calculation was used where the contribution of each bin was weighted by its fluorescence intensity level to generate a normalized trafficking score for each variant. Normalization was performed relative to the median scores of synonymous variants, resulting in a score where 1.0 represents wildtype-like trafficking. Each variant score was calculated using approximately 30.7 barcodes per replicate, allowing for precise estimation of 95% confidence intervals around each score.

Statistical thresholds for variant classification were established at specific percentile points of control distributions. Loss-of-trafficking variants were defined as having score estimates below 0.2 (97.5th percentile of early nonsense variants). Partial loss-of-trafficking variants had scores between 0.2 and 0.83 (2.5th percentile of synonymous variants). Normal trafficking variants fell between 0.83 and 1.18 (2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of synonymous variants). Gain-of-trafficking variants had scores above 1.18. Variants with confidence intervals spanning these thresholds were assigned to ""possible"" categories.","To calculate trafficking scores, reads that matched the expected 6-base sequences before and after each barcode were retained and aggregated. Only barcodes in the list of 80,282 “good” barcodes from the subassembly were used for subsequent analyses. The barcode counts were normalized to the total number of reads in each sample to calculate a ""reads per million"" metric. Next, the read counts were aggregated by variant and a weighted average was then calculated for each variant (Wv) based on counts in each bin. Next, the weighted averages were linearly transformed so that synonymous variants would have a median score of 1, and trafficking-null nonsense variants would have a median score of 0.

Variant classification is difficult, often because of lack of functional data. Moreover, variant-based risk stratification is also complicated by heterogenous clinical data and incomplete penetrance. Here we sought to test whether variant-specific information, primarily from high-throughput functional assays, could improve both classification and cardiac event risk stratification in a large, harmonized cohort of _KCNH2_ missense variant heterozygotes. Methods: We quantified cell-surface trafficking of 18 796 variants in _KCNH2_ using a multiplexed assay of variant effect (MAVE). We recorded _KCNH2_ current density for 533 variants by automated patch clamping. We calibrated the strength of evidence of MAVE data according to ClinGen guidelines. We deeply phenotyped 1458 patients with _KCNH2_ missense variants, including QTc, cardiac event history, and mortality. We correlated variant functional data and Bayesian long QT syndrome penetrance estimates with cohort phenotypes and assessed hazard ratios for cardiac events. Results: Variant MAVE trafficking scores and automated patch clamping peak tail currents were highly correlated (Spearman rank-order ρ=0.69; n=433). The MAVE data were found to provide up to pathogenic very strong evidence for severe loss-of-function variants. In the cohort, both functional assays and Bayesian long QT syndrome penetrance estimates were significantly predictive of cardiac events when independently modeled with patient sex and corrected QT interval (QTc); however, MAVE data became nonsignificant when peak tail current and penetrance estimates were also available. The area under the receiver operator characteristic curve for 20-year event outcomes based on patient-specific sex and QTc (area under the curve, 0.80 [0.76-0.83]) was improved with prospectively available penetrance scores conditioned on MAVE (area under the curve, 0.86 [0.83-0.89]) or attainable automated patch clamping peak tail current data (area under the curve, 0.84 [0.81-0.88]).

Established methods such as fluctuation tests and mutation accumulation experiments are low-throughput and often require significant optimization to ensure accuracy. We established a new method to determine the mutation rate of many strains simultaneously by tracking mutation events in a chemostat continuous culture device and applying deep sequencing to link mutations to alleles of a DNA-repair gene. We applied this method to assay the mutation rate of hundreds of Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains carrying mutations in the gene encoding Msh2, a DNA repair enzyme in the mismatch repair pathway. Loss-of-function mutations in MSH2 are associated with hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer, an inherited disorder that increases risk for many different cancers. However, the vast majority of MSH2 variants found in human populations have insufficient evidence to be classified as either pathogenic or benign. We first benchmarked our method against Luria-Delbrück fluctuation tests using a collection of published MSH2 missense variants. Our pooled screen successfully identified previously characterized nonfunctional alleles as high mutators. We then created an additional 185 human missense variants in the yeast ortholog, including both characterized and uncharacterized alleles curated from ClinVar and other clinical testing data. In a set of alleles of known pathogenicity, our assay recapitulated ClinVar's classification; we then estimated pathogenicity for 157 variants classified as uncertain or conflicting reports of significance. This method is capable of studying the mutation rate of many microbial species and can be applied to problems ranging from the generation of high-fidelity polymerases to measuring the frequency of antibiotic resistance emergence.",Ollodart,2021,human_amino_acid_numbering,meta-analysis,new position numbering,33848333,https://gsajournals.figshare.com/ndownloader/files/26650001,"Supp. Table 1.

In this system, pooled yeast strains containing barcoded MSH2 variants are grown for approximately 12-50 generations, during which time samples are plated on both selective (canavanine) and non-selective media to track the accumulation of mutations. The canavanine selection works by identifying yeast cells that have developed mutations in the CAN1 gene; when loss-of-function mutations occur in CAN1, the Can1 transporter becomes nonfunctional, preventing uptake of the toxic canavanine and allowing cells to survive on canavanine-containing media. The frequency of each barcoded variant is determined through amplicon sequencing of the barcode region, with MSH2 variants that have defective DNA repair function showing higher rates of spontaneous CAN1 mutations and thus more canavanine-resistant colonies.

For each variant, a linear regression model was applied to determine the rate of increase in mutant frequency over time, with the slope representing the mutation rate. Statistical robustness was enhanced by including multiple barcodes per variant (median of five barcodes per variant) and replicating experiments across four independent chemostats. Variant mutation rates were then divided by the median wild-type mutation rate from 737 internal control barcodes to calculate fold change values. Statistical significance of these fold changes was assessed using the Wilcoxan rank-sum test with Benjamini-Hochberg correction for multiple hypothesis testing (α=0.05).  A log2 transformation was applied to the fold change values to generate normalized scores, allowing variants to be binned into functional categories: potentially benign (<1.4× fold change), intermediate (1.3-1.4× fold change), possibly pathogenic (>1.4× fold change without statistical significance), and potentially pathogenic (>1.4× fold change with statistical significance).

The thresholds for functional classification were empirically determined based on statistical analyses and validation of known controls. The 1.4× fold change threshold was established as the minimum value that showed a statistically significant difference from wild-type in any variant after applying the Wilcoxan rank-sum test with Benjamini-Hochberg correction for multiple hypothesis testing. This threshold emerged after analyzing the distribution of fold changes across all variants, particularly the 28 variants with known pathogenicity classifications from ClinVar.

To date, Breast Cancer gene-2 (_BRCA2_) has the highest number of VUSs, which has necessitated the development of several robust functional assays to determine their functional significance. Here we report the use of a humanized-mouse embryonic stem cell (mESC) line expressing a single copy of the human _BRCA2_ for a CRISPR-Cas9-based high-throughput functional assay. As a proof-of-principle, we have saturated 11 codons encoded by BRCA2 exons 3, 18, 19 and all possible single-nucleotide variants in exon 13 and multiplexed these variants for their functional categorization. Specifically, we used a pool of 180-mer single-stranded donor DNA to generate all possible combination of variants. Using a high throughput sequencing-based approach, we show a significant drop in the frequency of non-functional variants, whereas functional variants are enriched in the pool of the cells. We further demonstrate the response of these variants to the DNA-damaging agents, cisplatin and olaparib, allowing us to use cellular survival and drug response as parameters for variant classification. Using this approach, we have categorized 599 _BRCA2_ variants including 93-single nucleotide variants (SNVs) across the 11 codons, of which 28 are reported in ClinVar. We also functionally categorized 252 SNVs from exon 13 into 188 functional and 60 non-functional variants, demonstrating that saturation genome editing (SGE) coupled with drug sensitivity assays can enhance functional annotation of _BRCA2_ VUS.",Sahu,2023,_exon13_SGE,primary score set,,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10529611/bin/pgen.1010940.s008.xlsx,"Exon 13 tab, Column D",Journal,PMC,,NM_000059.4,ENST00000380152.8,NM_000059.4,"A BRCA2 variant library was introduced into PL2F7/F7 mouse embryonic stem cells harboring a single-copy human BRCA2 transgene.

Owing to limited clinical, familial and epidemiological data, thousands of variants are considered to be variants of uncertain significance (VUS). Here we have utilized CRISPR-Cas9-based saturation genome editing in a humanized mouse embryonic stem cell line to determine the functional effect of VUS. We have categorized nearly all possible single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in the region that encodes the carboxylate-terminal DNA-binding domain of BRCA2. We have generated function scores for 6,551 SNVs, covering 96.4% of possible SNVs in exons 15-26 spanning BRCA2 residues 2479-3216. These variants include 1,282 SNVs that are categorized as missense VUS in the clinical variant database ClinVar, with 77.2% of these classified as benign and 20.4% classified as pathogenic using our functional score. Our assay provides evidence that 3,384 of the SNVs in the region are benign and 776 are pathogenic. Our classification aligns closely with pathogenicity data from ClinVar, orthogonal functional assays and computational meta predictors. We have integrated our embryonic stem cell-based BRCA2-saturation genome editing dataset with other available evidence and utilized the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics/Association for Molecular Pathology guidelines for clinical classification of all possible SNVs.

Several human _CRX_ variants cause degenerative retinopathies, but most are variants of uncertain significance. We performed a deep mutational scan (DMS) of nearly all possible single amino acid substitutions in _CRX_ using a cell-based transcriptional reporter assay, curating a high-confidence list of nearly 2000 variants with altered transcriptional activity. In the structured homeodomain, activity scores closely aligned to a predicted structure and demonstrated position-specific constraints on amino acid substitution. In contrast, the intrinsically disordered transcriptional effector domain displayed a qualitatively different pattern of substitution effects, following compositional constraints without specific residue position requirements in the peptide chain. These compositional constraints were consistent with the acidic exposure model of transcriptional activation. We evaluated the performance of the DMS assay as a clinical variant classification tool using gold-standard classified human variants from ClinVar, identifying pathogenic variants with high specificity and moderate sensitivity. That this performance could be achieved using a synthetic reporter assay in a foreign cell type, even for a highly cell type-specific TF like _CRX_, suggests that this approach shows promise for DMS of other TFs that function in cell types that are not easily accessible.

Quality control removed vBC-rBC pairs with fewer than three reads and vBCs with fewer than 10 unique rBCs in any fluorescence bin. Activity scores were calculated using a weighted sum approach, where the number of rBCs in each fluorescence bin was divided by the total across all bins, then multiplied by each bin's mean fluorescence intensity, creating a weighted average reflecting each variant's distribution across the fluorescence spectrum. The final activity scores were normalized by dividing by the wild-type _CRX_ score, establishing a relative scale where wild-type equals 1, while statistical confidence was assessed using a two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test comparing each variant's barcode-level activity distribution to wild-type, with FDR correction for multiple testing.

Functional classifications for _CRX_ variants were assigned by combining the normalized activity scores with statistical significance testing.

Classical homocystinuria, characterized by elevated homocysteine in plasma and urine, is caused by variants in the cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) gene, most of which are rare. With early detection, existing therapies are highly effective. Methods: Damaging CBS variants can be detected based on their failure to restore growth in yeast cells lacking the yeast ortholog CYS4. This assay has only been applied reactively, after first observing a variant in patients. Using saturation codon-mutagenesis, en masse growth selection, and sequencing, we generated a comprehensive, proactive map of CBS missense variant function. Results: Our CBS variant effect map far exceeds the performance of computational predictors of disease variants. Map scores correlated strongly with both disease severity (Spearman's ϱ = 0.9) and human clinical response to vitamin B6 (ϱ = 0.93).

An enrichment ratio (Φ) was calculated for each mutation using the adjusted selective and non-selective condition allele frequencies, with wildtype control libraries used to subtract PCR or sequencing errors from the observed allele frequencies. The final fitness score (sMUT) was then normalized using the formula ln(ΦMUT/ΦSTOP)/ln(ΦSYN/ΦSTOP), such that scores were calibrated to 0 for nonsense variants and 1 for synonymous variants. Standard errors for each score were derived via a weighted average of observed variance and a priori estimates, following an error regularization procedure. Well-measured variants were selected by applying filters that required pre-selection allele frequency to be greater than 0.005% and standard error to be less than 0.2.This score set represents growth in the presence of high B6. 

Functional classifications of CBS variants were assigned by establishing statistically-derived thresholds based on empirical null distributions. Using the fitness score distribution of all synonymous variants as an empirical null distribution, FDR-adjusted p-values were assigned to all missense variants.

Classical homocystinuria, characterized by elevated homocysteine in plasma and urine, is caused by variants in the cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) gene, most of which are rare. With early detection, existing therapies are highly effective. Methods: Damaging CBS variants can be detected based on their failure to restore growth in yeast cells lacking the yeast ortholog CYS4. This assay has only been applied reactively, after first observing a variant in patients. Using saturation codon-mutagenesis, en masse growth selection, and sequencing, we generated a comprehensive, proactive map of CBS missense variant function. Results: Our CBS variant effect map far exceeds the performance of computational predictors of disease variants. Map scores correlated strongly with both disease severity (Spearman's ϱ = 0.9) and human clinical response to vitamin B6 (ϱ = 0.93).

Sequencing was performed at a depth of approximately 2 million reads to ensure adequate coverage of variants. An enrichment ratio (Φ) was calculated for each mutation using the adjusted selective and non-selective condition allele frequencies, with wildtype control libraries used to subtract PCR or sequencing errors from the observed allele frequencies. The final fitness score (sMUT) was then normalized using the formula ln(ΦMUT/ΦSTOP)/ln(ΦSYN/ΦSTOP), such that scores were calibrated to 0 for nonsense variants and 1 for synonymous variants. Standard errors for each score were derived via a weighted average of observed variance and a priori estimates, following an error regularization procedure. Well-measured variants were selected by applying filters that required pre-selection allele frequency to be greater than 0.005% and standard error to be less than 0.2.  This score set represents growth in the presence of low B6. 

Functional classifications of CBS variants were assigned by establishing statistically-derived thresholds based on empirical null distributions. Using the fitness score distribution of all synonymous variants as an empirical null distribution, FDR-adjusted p-values were assigned to all missense variants.

A single combined estimate of measurement errors for scores in this map was derived by σ2 = 1/(1/(σ21+σ22)).",yeast,Saccharomyces cerevisiae (NCBI:txid4932),Not Applicable,,Not specified,MATα ts-hem3::KanR his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 ura3Δ0,,ts-hem3 - temperature sensitive human HMBS ortholog,Cell fitness,phenotypic (BAO_0013017),"cell viability assay (BAO_0003009), genetic complementation (BAO_0002488)",survival rate (OBI_0000789),,temperature sensitive growth (APO_0000092),,Selected and unselected population(s),"catalytic activity (GO:0003824), hydroxymethylbilane synthase activity (GO:0004418)
",loss_of_function_variant (SO:0002054),"The combined map scores were calculated as a weighted average when scores from both isoforms were available: (FS₁/σ²₁+FS₂/σ²₂)/(1/σ²₁+1/σ²₂), where FS₁ and FS₂ are the functional scores from each isoform and σ²₁ and σ²₂ are their respective variances. When only one score was available, that score was used directly in the combined map. 

For variant classification purposes, the functional scores were further transformed into log likelihood ratios of pathogenicity (LLRp). This was accomplished through kernel density estimation of the distributions of scores for known pathogenic and benign variants. The resulting LLRp value, calculated as log(π⁺(s)/π⁻(s)), represents the logarithm of the odds that a variant with score s belongs to the pathogenic rather than benign distribution. These LLRp values were calibrated to ACMG/AMP evidence strength categories following the approach of Tavtigian et al., establishing thresholds for different levels of evidence supporting pathogenicity or benignity.",,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,No,No,Raw score,HMBS variants were introduced into yeast with a temperature sensitive ortholog of HMBS (HEM3). ts HEM3 yeast strain does not grow well at non-permissive temperatures.

This study, while focused on RHO, demonstrates a streamlined, generalizable method for detecting pathogenic VUS. A relatively simple next-generation sequencing-based readout was developed so that a flow cytometry-based assay could be performed simultaneously on all variants in a pooled format, without the need for barcodes or viral transduction. The resulting dataset characterized the surface expression of every RHO library variant with a high degree of reproducibility (r2 = 0.92-0.95), recategorizing 37 variants. For example, three retinitis pigmentosa pedigrees were solved by identifying VUS which showed low expression levels (p.G18D, p.G101V, and p.P180T).

",loss_of_function_variant (SO:0002054),"The continuous log fold change (LFC) scores were calculated using DESeq2 to model the change in variant abundance over time. DESeq2 was employed to compute an apparent growth rate by treating time as a continuous variable, with days 4, 7, 10, 14, and 21 assigned the values 0, 3, 6, 10, and 17, respectively. The generalized linear model in DESeq2 includes an exponential function (log-link between the negative binomial distribution's central parameter and the linear regression term) to compute the log-linear growth rate. This approach produced a ""continuous LFC"" representing the change in variant abundance per unit time across all five time points. The calculation captured the variant depletion or enrichment kinetics throughout the 21-day screening period, with separate calculations initially performed for libraries A and B before their eventual combination into a final functional score.

Functional classifications in the BAP1 saturation genome editing (SGE) assay were assigned using a systematic approach based on both the functional score and statistical significance. For each variant, a z-score was calculated by dividing the combined log fold change (functional score) by its combined standard error, which was then used to generate p-values through a two-tailed z-test. These p-values underwent Benjamini-Hochberg correction for multiple testing to produce false discovery rate (FDR) values. Using these metrics, variants were classified into three categories: ""depleted"" (variants with FDR < 0.01 and negative functional score), ""enriched"" (variants with FDR < 0.01 and positive functional score), and ""unchanged"" (variants with FDR ≥ 0.01). This classification system effectively distinguished between variants that caused loss of function (depleted), potential gain of function (enriched), or had no significant effect on BAP1 function (unchanged), providing a framework for interpreting the functional consequences of thousands of BAP1 variants.","DESeq2 was used to calculate LFCs, dispersion estimates and statistical measures between D4 and D7, D10, D14 and D21 for variant counts. An apparent growth rate was computed in DESeq2, with time across time points represented as a continuous variable, such that days 4, 7, 10, 14 and 21 were assigned the values 0, 3, 6, 10 and 17, respectively, and the ‘continuous LFC’ produced represents the change in variant abundance per unit time. Pearson’s correlation between replicates was assessed, with any replicate time points demonstrating poor correlation removed from the analysis. To normalize the LFC of variant change against the LFCs of variants that are not expected to change in the screen, the default DESeq2 scaling factor was replaced with a normalization factor calculated based on synonymous and intronic variants for each time point replicate. The calculated LFCs were median scaled by subtracting the median LFC of synonymous and intronic variants for each target region. Target regions were evaluated in separate screens using library A and library B HDR plasmid repair templates, and median-scaled LFCs were combined to produce a single value using an inverse variance of the mean-weighted average63. Where target regions overlapped (in larger exons: 11.1, 11.2, 12.1, 12.2, 13.1, 13.2, 13.3, 17.1 and 17.2), median-scaled and weighted LFCs were again weighted based on variance to produce a final, single LFC for multiply observed variant LFCs, which is the ‘combined LFC’ or ‘functional score’.

All ‘functional classifications’ were made using the ‘functional score’ and its corresponding FDR. In summary, the continuous LFCs produced from DESeq2, which are LFCs per unit time over all time points (separately calculated for libraries A and B), were adjusted by median scaling and then the library values were combined by weighted average to produce the functional score. The functional score FDR for each variant was calculated by computing a z-score and then performing a z-test, which was then adjusted for multiple testing using the BH procedure.
